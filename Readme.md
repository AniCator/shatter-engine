# Shatter Engineâ„¢
This is a small game engine framework that is used to power some of my personal projects.

# Current Features
Here's a short list of things that are currently possible in the engine.

* Basic asset management for models, shaders, textures and audio
* Import and export of custom engine data such as binary model files
* Render passes
* Loading levels from script files
* Loading sub-levels from level script files
* Entity messaging

# Installation
Make sure you create an EngineMacros.props file for your game projects with a User Macro named EnginePath that points at the location of the engine solution file.

# Third Party
